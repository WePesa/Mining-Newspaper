Traditional standalone file systems aren't enough for current users demand because they need to store thousands of media files and access them everywhere at anytime. Recent file system must solve this problem being distributed and providing high-availability, replication and being reliable. We describe our PADI-FS design which provides a distributed file system interface. This file system is based on three metadata servers and hundreds of data servers which are controlled by client applications.
